# I Wanna Teach My Kid

This is a resource for anyone who wants to teach a young child English.  Be they parents, babysitters, or other teachers.  I am using my fifteen plus years teaching English as a Foreign Language in China, England and South Korea to create a central resource for anyone who wants them.  

I will share my experience a tips to creating `Resources that are so fun that the child won't even know they are learning!`
